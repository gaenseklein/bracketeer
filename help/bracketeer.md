# bracketeer - a plugin for handling brackets

this plugin aims to facilitate the workflow with brackets. it lets you
- create corresponding end-bracket on the fly (like the quoter plugin)
- put marked text into brackets (like the quoter plugin)
- get rid of quotes surrounding marked text (press same quote as surounding removes quote)
- move to next / last bracket (alt-left alt-right)
- mark text in brackets on cursor-position (alt-m)
